When you display a polymer in VMD, you can color the atoms according to their position in the chain using this menu option:
"Graphics"->"Representations"->"Coloring Method"->"Index" 

However the default color scheme is red-white-and-blue.
At this point you can load a custom colormap which is more to your liking by opening the "Extensions"->"Tk Console" menu option, and selecting a .TCL file from the file menu containing colormap settings.

This directory contains two colormaps:

jet   (linear)

HSV   (circular)
